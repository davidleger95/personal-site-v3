    Hey, I'm David! I’m a third year Software Engineering student at the University of New Brunswick (UNB). Writing code is more than just a job to me — it’s part of who I am. I believe that software development is an art which necessitates the blending of creative thought and technical skill. I’m driven by a ceaseless desire to build something that changes the world.

    Although I’m in working towards a degree in software engineering, my skills in web development are almost completely self-taught. I first started writing code in grade 10 (2010) as a freelance web designer and developer. Since then, I’ve continued to  grow my skills as a web developer and I now have over five years of experience building websites and web applications in my spare time.

    As a designer, I started even earlier than I did with coding. I got into graphic design in grade 8 (2008) designing logos and inventing new board games for me and my firends to play. I continued to dabble with graphic design off-and-on since then, but it wasn’t until about a year ago that I began actively improving my UI and UX design skills through self-teaching and continual practice.

    Most recently I became a content creator; writing posts, producing videos and coding projects for my website, [Whitespace](www.0xfff.space). I started Whitespace as a means to teach myself new skills in design, problem solving, programming, and career planning. I hope that by publishing my work, it will motivate me to complete projects more quickly. I also hope that my work will be a source of inspiration, knowledge, and guidance to others.
