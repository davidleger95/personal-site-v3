hey: |
    Hey, I'm David! I’m a third year Software Engineering student at the
    University of New Brunswick (UNB). Writing code is more than just a job to
    me — it’s part of who I am. I believe that software development is an art
    which necessitates the blending of creative thought and technical skill.
    I’m driven by a ceaseless desire to build something that changes the world.

    Although I’m in working towards a degree in software engineering, my skills
    in web development are almost completely self-taught. I first started
    writing code in grade 10 (2010) as a freelance web designer and developer.
    Since then, I’ve continued to  grow my skills as a web developer and I now
    have over five years of experience building websites and web applications
    in my spare time.

    What I like most about web development is I get to express my creativity
    and share it with the world. I'm driven by the idea that code is not a
    purely technical skill but also a medium for art.
