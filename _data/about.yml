biography: |
    Hey, I'm David! I’m a fourth year Software Engineering student at the
    University of New Brunswick (UNB). Writing code is more than just a job to
    me — it’s part of who I am. What I like most about web development is I get
    to express my creativity and share it with the world. I'm driven by the
    idea that code is not a purely technical skill but also a medium for art.

    Although I’m in working towards a degree in software engineering, my skills in
    web development are almost completely self-taught. I first started writing
    code in grade 10 (2010) as a freelance web designer and web developer. Since
    then, I’ve continued to grow my programming skills and I now have over five
    years of experience building websites and web applications both professionally
    and in my spare time.
