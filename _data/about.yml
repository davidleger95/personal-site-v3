    Hey, I'm David! I graduated with a degree in Software Engineering from the
    University of New Brunswick (UNB) in May 2018. I love frontend web development and design.
    I'm especially fond of React/Redux, user experience, and web accessibility. I currently 
    work at Cvent building Inquisium.
