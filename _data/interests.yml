    subtitle: "React.js & Redux, Express.js, Node.js, MongoDB"
    description: |
        I believe that component-based architecture is the future of web
        development and React and Redux are currently the most attractive option
        out there. I like using Express with Node, and MongoDB on the server
        side of things because using JavaScript throught the entire system makes
        communication between the client and server seamless.

  - title: Internet of Things
    description: |
        The Internet of Things interests me because I believe it is the perfect
        niche in which software engineers can thrive. Students of computer
        science (CS) rarely get to work with physical hardware in their course
        work, and students of electrical & computer engineering (ECE) rarely
        get the chance to write higher-level code. What makes software
        engineering different is that it’s a hybird degree of CS and ECE,
        giving students in-depth knowledge and practice in both hardware and
        software.

  - title: Machine Learning
    description: |
        I believe the greatest applications are ones that can think for
        themselves. Making smart software that can be proactive with its users
        enables greater usability and an optimal user experience. Although I am
        a novice in this area of computer science, I’m eagar to learn more about
        it and to start building software that implements this concept.

  - title: Project Management
    description: |
        Ultimately, I would love to be a project manager. Even though I like
        getting my hands dirty and writing code, I believe I’m on a tragectory
        for project management because of my broad knowledge of languages,
        frameworks, tools, and technologies. I also have a unique set of skills
        including problem solving, programming, design, hardware, and workflow,
        which will allow me to be an asset in all parts of a given project from
        start to finish.

  - title: UI/UX Design
    description: |
        I believe good software starts with a good user interface and user
        experience, but many programmers have almost no concept of UI or UX
        design, which results in sloppy interfaces that are hard to use. The
        benefit in having both design and coding skills is that I know the
        limitations and capabilities of the medium for which I’m designing. I
        like UI/UX design because it is expressive, and it allows me to combine
        my artistic and technical skills in single project.
